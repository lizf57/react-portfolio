            <p className='about-text text-left p-4 m-3 fs-4'>I appreciate your time in reviewing my portfolio. My coding journey commenced in May 2023 through the University of Wisconsin-Madison's online Coding Bootcamp, which spanned approximately six months.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            From the Bootcamp, I acquired a diverse set of skills for web development. I learned to construct front-end websites, whether from scratch or through the use of established frameworks. This knowledge extends to building full-stack single-page web applications, utilizing RESTful API routes, AJAX methods, and understanding the interaction between front-end and back-end systems. I also delve into structured and unstructured databases, transfomring static websites into dynamic, data-persistent platforms. I developed teamwork and project management abilities, both as a collaborative team member and an independent contributor in complex project envirnoments. A couple team projects completed during the Bootcamp are shown on my project page: Cullinary Climate and Career Craft.

             Beyond the realm of coding, my interests encompass a deep appreciation for the outdoors. I enjoy hiking, traveling, photography, art, and running. In summary, my coding journey has instilled a strong foundation of technical skills and a passion for web development.</p>
